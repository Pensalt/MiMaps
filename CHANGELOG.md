## _Version 2.0_
##### Class: MapsFragment.java

- **private LatLng startLocation** changed name to '**landmarkLocation**' as it better defines the variables function.
- Added functionality for generating a route to a users favourite landmark after they click to view the landmark. Users can navigate to this destination as if they had searched it or chtapped it on the map.

## _Feedback Addressed_
